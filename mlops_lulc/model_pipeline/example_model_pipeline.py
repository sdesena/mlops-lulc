# Hi I am a Custom Python MLFlow model.
# Usually, when you log models in an mlflow experiment, you would use the
# log_model() from the ML python library that you are using to train your model.
# For e.g., if you use tensorflow, you would do something like
# mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(model)
# Now, this model can be registered and then be deployed using docker
# containers or locally. Then you can send requests with your input data to
# this model. But if you have to do some preprocessing and/or postprocessing
# steps before/after the prediction, you either have to create your own
# FastAPI or Flask server to do that or you can make use of MLFlow's custom
# python models as shown below.

# PLEASE DELETE ME AFTER YOU ARE DONE UNDERSTANDING!!
